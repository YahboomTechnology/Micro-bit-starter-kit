Since the micro:bit hardware has been upgraded, programs that use accelerometer and compasses need to import the program from the online programming into the microbit drive letter.
Importing in offline programming software is not working properly.

Method: Open the program directly with online programming, and then import it into the micro:bit drive letter.
